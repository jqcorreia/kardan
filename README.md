# Kardan

_Setups the isolated development environment for the D programming language._

Kardan uses docker to produces a configurable development toolkit for the D programming language.

With this project you can produce an archive containing the D compilers (currently DMD and LDC2), the standard library and the DUB package manager. All the tools are built from source code and as a result a tar archive is created that is used to create a base image for development of D applications.
